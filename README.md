What is Generative AI?
Understanding Generative AI
Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that can create text, images, music, and even code based on patterns learned from large datasets. It uses machine learning models trained on vast amounts of data to generate human-like responses and content.

How GPT Works in This Bot
This bot utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), which is a transformer-based generative AI model.
It takes previous chat history as input and predicts the most natural and relevant response.
The bot can hold context-aware conversations by continuously appending messages to a chat history file.
It generates responses using OpenAI’s completion API, allowing dynamic and intelligent replies.
